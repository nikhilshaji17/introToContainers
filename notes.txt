Containers used to be called Linux Jails.

They are essentially 3 linux features taped together. 
1. Jailed processes
2. Control groups
3. Namespaces

We will jail a process, keep it resources to itself, and adding it to a C group.

Why containers:
Earlier, you had to run your code directly on your own server. This means you would have
  to take care of the OS and the hardware itself, including who can access the servers, the
  temperature of the room, power thats served to the servers etc.

  This means you would have to buy servers, then pay someone to take care of them, or take
  care of them yourself.

The next step was virtual machines, we can now take our server, and split it into virtual 
  machines, to run multiple applications

Now, you don't need to keep buying new servers for new applications. However, you still need to:
  a. Security patch your own servers
  b. Manage your own OS

Containers take the concept of virtual machines, but they avoid the need to keep duplicating
  operating systems for each virtual machines. So they are lighter
